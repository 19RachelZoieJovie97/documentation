# Visual Studio

The JFrog Visual Studio Extension adds JFrog Xray scanning of NuGet project dependencies to your Visual Studio IDE. It allows developers to view panels displaying vulnerability information about the components and their dependencies directly in Visual Studio. With this information, a developer can make an informed decision on whether to use a component or not before it gets entrenched into the organizationâ€™s product.

The extension filter allows you view the scanned results according to issues severity.
