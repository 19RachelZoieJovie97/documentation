# Using the JFrog Extension in VS Code

The local view of the extension adds JFrog Xray scanning of project dependencies and source code to your VS Code IDE. It allows developers to view panels displaying vulnerability information about their dependencies and source code in their VS Code IDE. With this information, a developer can make an informed decision on whether to use a component or not before it gets entrenched into the organizationâ€™s product.

### The CI View

The CI view of the extension allows you to view information about your builds directly from your CI system. This allows developers to keep track of the status of their code, while it is being built, tested and scanned as part of the CI pipeline, regardless of the CI provider used.

This information can be viewed inside JFrog VS Code Extension, from the JFrog Panel, after switching to CI mode.

The following details can be made available in the CI view.

* Status of the build run (passed or failed)
* Build run start time
* Git branch and latest commit message
* Link to the CI run log
* Security information about the build artifacts and dependencies

#### How Does It Work?

The CI information displayed in VS Code is pulled by the JFrog Extension directly from JFrog Artifactory. This information is stored in Artifactory as part of the build-info, which is published to Artifactory by the CI server.

Read more about build-info in the [Build Integration](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Build+Integration) documentation page. If the CI pipeline is also configured to scan the build-info by JFrog Xray, the JFrog VS Code Extension will pull the results of the scan from JFrog Xray and display them in the CI view as well.

#### Setting Up Your CI Pipeline

Before VS Code can display information from your CI in the CI View, your CI pipeline needs to be configured to expose this data. Read [this guide](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Setting+Up+CI+Integration) which describes how to configure your CI pipeline.

#### Setting Up the CI View

Set your CI build name in the Build name pattern field at the [Extension Settings](broken-reference). This is the name of the build published to Artifactory by your CI pipeline. You have the option of setting \* to view all the builds published to Artifactory.

After your builds were fetched from Artifactory, press on the Builds  button to choose what build to display.
