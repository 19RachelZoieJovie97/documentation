# Eclipse

The JFrog Eclipse plugin adds JFrog Xray scanning of Maven, Gradle, and npm project dependencies to your Eclipse IDE. It allows developers to view panels displaying vulnerability information about the components and their dependencies directly in their Eclipse IDE. With this information, a developer can make an informed decision on whether to use a component or not before it gets entrenched into the organizationâ€™s product.

The plugin filter allows you view the scanned results according to issues or licenses.
