# Scan your Project

The JFrog IntelliJ IDEA Plugin enables continuous scans of your project with the JFrog Platform. The security-related information will be displayed under the Local view. It allows developers to view vulnerability information about their dependencies and source code in their IDE. With this information, a developer can make an informed decision on whether to use a component or not before it gets entrenched into the organizationâ€™s product.

Scan your project by clicking the Run Scan button. After the scan is done, a list of vulnerable files will appear.
